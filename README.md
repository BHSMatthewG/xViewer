# xViewer
A Program that allows you to view basic Methods/Classes/Namespaces using .NET Reflection.

## Notice
Decompilation does not Fully work yet, it can generate a method constructor but that is it for now.
I will update this in the future, as I love to return back to my roots and old projects.
But this will take time for me, as I am currently invested in another project right now.
